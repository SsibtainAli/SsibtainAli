- Hi, I’m Sibtain, I'm a physics student who likes creating simulations of physics problems.
- I have expertise in C++, Python, Matlab and Mathematica.
- Currently, I'm working on developing C++ algorithms using ROOT for jet classification in high-energy physics data analysis.
- If you have any questions about any of my codes, you can reach me at sibtaingillani55@gmail.com
- Fun fact: I dance robotic while coding.
